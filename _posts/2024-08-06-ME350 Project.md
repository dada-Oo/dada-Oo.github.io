### **Project Overview**

><span style="font-size:21px">This team project focuses on designing a transformable wheel vehicle using a Geneva mechanism, where I'm responsible for CAD modeling and physical assembly. Also helps to improve the code.</span>

## **Highlights**

### **Top-Down Design**

><span style="font-size:18px">The top-down design approach allows for dimension adjustments at any stage of the development process with only one step. Below is a GIF demonstration:</span>

### **Whole Vehicle Modeling** and **All 3D Printed**

<span style="font-size:18px">The vehicle was fully modeled using **Solidworks**, including the chassis and wheels, with all parts designed for seamless integration.

><span style="font-size:18px">Through a deep understanding of **PLA** material properties, I optimized the design for 3D printing, creating a lightweight, hollow chassis that maintained strength while reducing weight and material use.

## **Abilities**

### Climbing Stairs
<span style="font-size:18px">The car is equipped with a **transformable wheel** mechanism that allows it to adapt its wheel size and shape, enabling it to climb stairs. (No hand touch)

### Traversing Sand Pits
<span style="font-size:18px">With its flexible wheels and robust design, the car can easily traverse uneven terrains like sand pits.

### Color Recognition for Turning and Stopping
<span style="font-size:18px">The car is equipped with a camera that **recognizes specific colors** (e.g., red and green). When the car detects a signal, it turns in the corresponding direction, and automatically stops in the parking slot.
