## **Robots**

### **Asia Open Robots**

<span style="font-size:18px">These two vehicles helped us win the championship. It was my **first time** fully applying **top-down design** to model an entire vehicle. The frequent errors in SolidWorks gave me the chance to rethink and better understand the logic behind top-down design.

#### Small-Robot

<span style="font-size:18px">This is the blueprint of the small vehicle, for which I was responsible for **designing the chassis**.
</span>

#### Big-Robot

<span style="font-size:18px">Unfortunately, the blueprint for the large vehicle was lost. I was the **operator** of the large vehicle and also responsible for **designing** its main scoring mechanisms, including the **climbing system** and the **side-expanding wings**.

#### Manufacturing Process

### **World Championship Robots**

<span style="font-size:18px">As it was my first time competing worldwide, my skill level wasn't high enough, and we ended up finishing in the **quarterfinals**.

#### Small-Robot

![Small Robot Blueprint](/assets/img/worldSmall.png){: width="360" .right}

<span style="font-size:18px">This small vehicle is the result of my exploration for a more optimized design after my first attempt. On the right is the full vehicle blueprint, and **apart from the intake, I designed the entire car**. I was also the **operator** for this vehicle. It features an impressive **12 motors**, which is remarkable considering most other vehicles only had 8. The increased speed meant a much **higher scoring potential**.
