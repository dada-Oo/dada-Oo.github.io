# [My Jekyll Website](dada-oo.github.io)

This website is built using the [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, which provides a fast, responsive, and modern layout for Jekyll-based websites. I have made several custom modifications to suit the needs of myself.

## Key Features

- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- SEO and performance optimization.
- Multiple layouts, customizable sidebar, and various sections like categories, tags, and archives.
- Integrated support for dark/light mode.
- Modified design and content to align with my project's objectives.

## Modifications

- Customized the layout and styling of the sidebar.
- Added specific functionalities such as GIFs for demonstrating features of a mechanical project.
- Updated navigation menus and page structures to fit my personal workflow.
- Adjusted the configurations in `_config.yml` to better reflect my content and organization.

## Credits

This website is based on the **Chirpy** theme. I would like to express my gratitude to the original author of Chirpy for their excellent work and contributions to the Jekyll community.
